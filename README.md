# Harini Master Thesis



## Topic: MRI Reconstruction using diffusion models

## Goals:
    Familiarize with data
    MRI to k-space(inverse fourier transform) - Undersampling
    Currently used architecture is VarNet
    Use stable diffusion and score based diffusion models for MRI reconstruction
    Do statistical analysis



## Project status
    Getting familiarized with dataset
    Understanding diffusion models
