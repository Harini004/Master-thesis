# Harini Master Thesis



## Topic: MRI Reconstruction using diffusion models

## Goals:
    Familiarize with data
    MRI to k-space(inverse fourier transform) - Undersampling
    Currently used architecture is VarNet
    Use stable diffusion and score based diffusion models for MRI reconstruction
    Do statistical analysis



## Project status
    Getting familiarized with dataset
    Splitting test data from training - in progress
    Understanding diffusion models
    Score based diffusion models has been setup
    Running inference on test data
## Future steps
    Do evaluation on inference data
    Compare the results with stable or VarNet whichever is promising
